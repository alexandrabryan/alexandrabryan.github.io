<h1>Hi! I'm <span class="bold">Alexandra Bryan</span>, a web developer located in Pittsburgh, PA. </h1>

<section class="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a Ruby on Rails web developer, inspired to create build software that makes a difference. I 
            strongly believe that the best software comes from a foundation of empathy and human connection,
            because the most impactful programs and apps are the ones that draw people 
            together and connect a shared experience.
        </p>
        <p> I have extensive experience in conceptualizing, planning, and creating products 
            solely with the end user in mind -  from email marketing campaigns and web applications, to
            blog posts and goal-based curriculum. I also love to learn, and share that learning with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently graduated from Develop Camp, a coding and professional development program run by Moms Can: Code.  
            I'm also a certified secondary English teacher, holding a B.A. in Journalism and Communications 
            from Rowan University and a M.A. in Teaching from California University of Pennsylvania.
