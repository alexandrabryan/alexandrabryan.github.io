            <h1>Hi! I'm <span class="bold">Alexandra Bryan</span>, a web developer located in Pittsburgh, PA. </h1>
            <h2>I like to make things that matter</h2>
            <h2> and are thoughtfully designed.</h2>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a Ruby on Rails web developer, inspired to create build software that makes a difference. I
                strongly believe that the best software comes from a foundation of empathy and human connection,
                because the most impactful programs and apps are the ones that draw people
                together and connect a shared experience.
            </p>
            <p> I have extensive experience in conceptualizing, planning, and creating products
                solely with the end user in mind - from email marketing campaigns and web applications, to
                blog posts and goal-based curriculum. I also love to learn, and share that learning with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently graduated from Develop Camp, a coding and professional development program run by Moms Can:
                Code.
                I'm also a certified secondary English teacher, holding a B.A. in Journalism and Communications
                from Rowan University and a M.A. in Teaching from California University of Pennsylvania.
