            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was also done as a pair programming assignment, and aimed to create a MVP ecommerce website for a fictional 
              boutique, Authentic Grace. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we designed and coded a site with the following features: 
              modern, consistent aesthetic, responsive design, drop down navigation menu, multiple pages (about / shop / blog / faq),  
              social media icons, and a subscription popup. 
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                This project was completed as an exercise in pair programming. To accomplish our wish list, we took a “divide 
                and conquer” approach, where each of us took the reins on a few different features after decided upon the 
                design and direction of the site. I took the lead on the main landing page, the “about” page, and the sample 
                “blog” page.  I was also responsible for laying out the wireframe in Figma and designing the logo, sourcing 
                and uploading images, and the color story.

            <h2>Research and Process</h2>
            <p>
                we spent a little time researching some named "competitor" boutique sites in our provided user story, and looked for 
                the features (in both design and functionality) that we could use for inspiration. After creating our features list, 
                finalizing a wireframe and deciding on design elements, we built the site from scratch - no templates here!
