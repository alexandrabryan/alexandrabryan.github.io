            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was also done as a pair programming assignment, and aimed to create a MVP ecommerce website for a fictional 
              boutique, Authentic Grace. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we designed and coded a site with the following features: 
              modern, consistent aesthetic, responsive design, drop down navigation menu, multiple pages (about / shop / blog / faq),  
              social media icons, and a subscription popup.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                This project was completed as an exercise in pair programming. To accomplish our wish list, we took a “divide 
                and conquer” approach, where each of us took the reins on a few different features after decided upon the 
                design and direction of the site. I took the lead on the main landing page, the “about” page, and the sample 
                “blog” page.  I was also responsible for laying out the wireframe in Figma and designing the logo, sourcing 
                and uploading images, and the color story.

            <h2>Research and Process</h2>
            <p>
                After an initial research process, we conducted an online survey of over 200 people from around the world. 
                Our goal was to design and develop a product to help people regain connection in their lives and feel less lonely
                and isolated. We were particularly interested in the the segment of participant aged 45+.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note here, that at the time of the survey, we did not know what we were going to build. While we knew
                we wanted to center a solution around connection, we did not know who our target audience would be for our product, but rather
                looked to use our survey results to inform about the problems faced by this segment and how they used both on and off line 
                avenues to make connections in their lives currently. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We conducted a survey to identify key issues facing the aging population. Based on our survey, of 244 total responses 
                (all age groups) 114 of them feel isolated at least some of the time. And of those 114 people who feel isolated, 
                101 of them interact in person with friends and family either a few times a week or every day. 
 

                Narrowing the problem down further, we identified that the communication in caring for an aging family member 
                can be confusing, sporadic, and disproportionately fall on one or two people. We want to give caregivers the means to 
                form a small, private network of communication all in one place. This will empower the elder to remain connected and 
                involved while giving the caregiving network a way to support and communicate effectively with both the elder and the 
                network.
