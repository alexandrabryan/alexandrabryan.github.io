            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was created by Team 2 from MomsCan:Code Develop Camp, cohort 1. It is a collaborative web app built by a 
                remote team of 4 moms-turned-coders as a result of a 3 week sprint project, using the Human-Centered Design Thinking process.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were presented with a fact ("The elderly will outnumber their children for the first time in US history.") and 
                followed the design thinking process to eventually identify a problem with our target user, and prototype a solution to 
                that problem. The design thinking steps involved doing initial research, creating a stakeholder map, empathizing with 
                the user, data collection via suverys and interviews, defining a problem and ideating solutions. 
                In about a week, we had gone from the fact above to a "big idea" to wireframe and prototype. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our pitch - "Our team of web developer moms is building a web app to help caregivers of aging family members easily 
                build a support network with a single hub to communicate and coordinate care."
            </p>
            <p>
                We then used Figma to create a low fidelity wireframe to outline the user experience and main functionality of the 
                app, then got to work! The app was deployed via Heroku, and uses PostgreSQL as its database.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                My role in this project was primarily as the team lead. I made sure that the team was communicating effectively, 
                helped troubleshoot whenever needed, updated documentation, planned meetings and agendas, and coordinated all our
                 varied experience levels and efforts to complete our MVP within the deadline. I was also responsible for laying 
                 out the wireframe in Figma, establishing and integrating the app’s database using PostgreSQL, configuring the 
                 user authentication system with RoR’s Devise gem, and deploying the app via Heroku.

            <h2>Research and Process</h2>
            <p>
                After an initial research process, we conducted an online survey of over 200 people from around the world. 
                Our goal was to design and develop a product to help people regain connection in their lives and feel less lonely
                and isolated. We were particularly interested in the the segment of participant aged 45+.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note here, that at the time of the survey, we did not know what we were going to build. While we knew
                we wanted to center a solution around connection, we did not know who our target audience would be for our product, but rather
                looked to use our survey results to inform about the problems faced by this segment and how they used both on and off line 
                avenues to make connections in their lives currently. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We conducted a survey to identify key issues facing the aging population. Based on our survey, of 244 total responses 
                (all age groups) 114 of them feel isolated at least some of the time. And of those 114 people who feel isolated, 
                101 of them interact in person with friends and family either a few times a week or every day. 
 

                Narrowing the problem down further, we identified that the communication in caring for an aging family member 
                can be confusing, sporadic, and disproportionately fall on one or two people. We want to give caregivers the means to 
                form a small, private network of communication all in one place. This will empower the elder to remain connected and 
                involved while giving the caregiving network a way to support and communicate effectively with both the elder and the 
                network.
